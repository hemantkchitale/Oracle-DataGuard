-- a quick script to execute at the Primary
-- retrieves SCNs from Primary and Standby
-- SCN_TO_TIMESTAMP works only at the Primary which is OPEN
-- SCNs are updated approximately every 3seconds
-- so you may run this script a few times over a minute
select scn_to_timestamp(current_scn) 
          - scn_to_timestamp(applied_scn)   
          as Time_Diff
from v$database d,
(select applied_scn from  v$archive_dest a where target = 'STANDBY')
-- if the query returns :
-- ORA-08181: specified number is not a valid system change number
-- ORA-06512: at "SYS.SCN_TO_TIMESTAMP", line 1
-- it would mean that the last SCN from the Standby is very old
-- older than what the SCN_TO_TIMESTAMP function can return
